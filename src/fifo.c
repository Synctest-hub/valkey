/* The FifoBlock contains up to 7 items (pointers).  When compared with adlist, this results in
 * roughly 60% memory reduction and 7x fewer memory allocations.  Memory reduction is guaranteed
 * with 5+ items in queue.
 *
 * In each block, there are 7 slots for item pointers (pointers to the caller's FIFO item).
 *  We need to keep track of the first & last slot used.  Contextually, we will only need
 *  a single index - either the first slot used or the last slot used.  Based on context,
 *  we can determine what is needed.
 *
 * Blocks are linked together in a chain.  If the list is empty, there are no blocks.
 *  For non-empty lists, we will either have a single block OR a chain of blocks.
 *
 * For a SINGLE BLOCK containing (for example) 4 items, the layout looks like this:
 *                 +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
 *  SINGLE BLOCK:  | slot 0 | slot 1 | slot 2 | slot 3 | slot 4 | slot 5 | slot 6 | next/  | 
 *                 |  item  |  item  |  item  |  item  |   -    |   -    |   -    | lastIdx|
 *                 +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
 *                                                ^
 *                                             lastIdx (3)
 *  In single blocks, the items are always shifted so that the first item is in slot 0.
 *  We need to keep track of the lastIdx so that we will know where to push the next item.
 *  The last index is stored in the final 3 bits of the (unused) next pointer
 *
 * When MULTIPLE BLOCKS are chained together, items will be popped from the first block, and
 *  pushed onto the last block.  All blocks in the middle are full.  In the first block, we keep
 *  the firstIdx (so we know where to pop) ... on the last block, we keep lastIdx (so we know
 *  where to push).
 *
 * Example FIRST BLOCK with 2 items remaining:
 *                 +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
 *  FIRST BLOCK:   | slot 0 | slot 1 | slot 2 | slot 3 | slot 4 | slot 5 | slot 6 | next/  | 
 *                 |   -    |   -    |   -    |   -    |   -    |  item  |  item  |firstIdx|
 *                 +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
 *                                                                  ^
 *                                                              firstIdx (5)
 * Example LAST BLOCK with 3 items pushed so far:
 *                 +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
 *  LAST BLOCK:    | slot 0 | slot 1 | slot 2 | slot 3 | slot 4 | slot 5 | slot 6 | next/  | 
 *                 |  item  |  item  |  item  |   -    |   -    |   -    |   -    | lastIdx|
 *                 +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
 *                                        ^
 *                                    lastIdx (2)
